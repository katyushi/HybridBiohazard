  <p>The universal rule for burning by fire is to cease the source of the flames;<br>
  then use cold water to cool the affected area.</p>
<p>This is the indicated output, since there are no
 medication, product or homemade recipe  
to reduce the pain caused by a 
burn or improve the injury.</p>
<p>The famous ointments, even those available
 in pharmacies, stress still
 the skin cells, irritating it and
 causing infections.</p><p><b>If bubbles appear, do not
 blow them at all:</b></p><p> they are
 natural protection against burns.</p>
 <p>Bubbles are typical of second degree burns, 
deeper, and should only be handled by a physician.</p>
<b>Avoid:</b>
 <p>wrapping the lesion with tissues or cotton they can stick.</p>
  <p>Accessories such as watches, bracelets, rings, laces
 and earrings, on the other hand, should be withdrawn.</p>
 <p>This is because the human body tends to expand after suffering a burn and
 these objects can get stuck.</p>
